Feature: Ensure translations

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with "Admin" permission
    Given the following translations exist:
      | locale | key        | value                   |
      | ar     | xxxx       | Arabic Translated Name  |
      | en     | xxxx       | English Translated Name |
      | ru     | yyyy       | Whatever                |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Field label translations
    When I set the system language to "English"-"en"
    And I set the user language to "العربية"-"ar"
    Then I should see "Arabic Translated Name" translated

  @javascript
  Scenario: Field label translation missing
    When I set the system language to "العربية"-"ar"
    And I set the user language to "Русский"-"ru"
    Then I should see "Arabic Translated Name" translated
    And I logout


  @javascript
  Scenario: View system language changed by Admin
  As an Admin I change the system language
  So that when I login as a system user I can view the app in the changed language

    When I set the system language to "العربية"-"ar"
    And  I logout

    Given an user "jerry" with password "123"
    When I fill in "jerry" for "user_name"
    And I fill in "123" for "password"
    And I press "Log in"

    Then I should see my system language as "العربية"-"ar"

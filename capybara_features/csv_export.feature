Feature: 

  As a user
  I want to be able to export data as CSV 
  So that an user has flexibility in how the use the data in the system

  Background:
    Given the following children exist in the system:
      | name    | unique_id| created_by |
      | Dan     | dan_123  | user1      |
      | Dave    | dave_456 | user1      |
      | Mike    | mike_789 | user1      |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Users can export to CSV as the result of a search
    Given I am logged in as a user with "View And Search Child,Export to Photowall/CSV/PDF" permissions
    When I search using a name of "D"
    And I wait until "full_results" is visible
    And I select search result #1
    And I press "Export to CSV"
    Then password prompt should be enabled

  Scenario: When there are no search results, there is no csv export link
    Given I am logged in as a user with "View And Search Child,Export to Photowall/CSV/PDF" permissions
    When I search using a name of "Z" 
    Then I should not see "Export to CSV"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Admins can export some or all child records to CSV
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And the date/time is "Oct 23 2010"

    And I follow "Export" for child records
    And I follow "Export Some Records to CSV" for child records
    And I search using a name of "D"
    And I select search result #1
    And I press "Export to CSV"
    Then password prompt should be enabled

    Then password prompt should be enabled

  As a user
  I want to go to a website and change the child's record
  So that I can update details of children that are found in the field

  Scenario: Editing a child record
    Given I am logged in as a user with "Register Child,Edit Child" permission

    # creating a record
    Given I am on children listing page
    And I follow "Register New Child"

    When I fill in "Jorge Just" for "Name"
    And I fill in "27" for "Date of Birth / Age"
    And I select "Male" from "Sex"
    And I fill in "London" for "Nationality"
    And I fill in "Haiti" for "Birthplace"
    And I attach a photo "features/resources/jorge.jpg"
    And I press "Save"

    # editing the created record
    Then I follow "Edit"

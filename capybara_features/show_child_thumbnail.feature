Feature:

  As a user
  I want to see the thumbnail of the child's photo while editing the child's record
  So that I can have a preview of the most recent uploaded photo of a child

  Scenario: Seeing thumbnail when editing a child record

    Given I am logged in
    And an existing child with name "John" and a photo from "features/resources/jorge.jpg"

    When I am editing the child with name "John"

    Then I should see the thumbnail of "John"

Feature: Reunited Child

  As a Field Worker
  I want to easily and visibly mark a Child Record as Reunited
  So that it is immediately apparent when a child has been reunited with her family

  Background:

   Given I am logged in as a user with "Register Child,Edit Child,View And Search Child" permission
   And the following children exist in the system:
     | name   | unique_id  | reunited |
     | Will   | will_uid   | false    |
     | Will 2 | will_uid_2 | false    |
     | Fred   | fred_uid   | true     |
     | Fred 2 | fred_uid_2 | true     |

    @javascript
  Scenario: Mark a child as Reunited and check flag on the View Child Record Page
    When I am on the child record page for "Will"
    And I follow "Mark as Reunited"
     And I fill in "child_reunited_message" with "Because I say it is reunited"
     And I click the "Reunite" button
    Then I should see "Child was successfully updated."
     And I should see 1 divs with text "Reunited" for class "reunited-message"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Mark a child as Not Reunited  and check flag on the View Child Record Page
    When I am on the child record page for "Fred"
     And I follow "Mark as Not Reunited"
     And I fill in "child_reunited_message" with "Because I say it is not reunited"
     And I click the "Undo Reunite" button
    Then I should see "Child was successfully updated."
